# Dark Mode Switcher with Sun and Moon

This repository is inspired on the work of EkNumberStudios animation (Instagram @eknumberstudios) for light-dark mode switcher on After Effects. I tried recreating it without using layers nor animations for what happens inside the switcher, mostly focusing on the sun and moon themselves.
